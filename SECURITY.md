# Security Policy

(Only applies to those not associated with LCHS)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability that is only conditionally abuseable, go ahead and post in [Issues](https://github.com/SalmonSeasoning/lchs-railers-esports-bot/issues)
and we'll get to fixing it.

If a vulnerability is unconditionally abuseable or allows for privilege escalation or can hijack the bot itself, please email [jvazquez@lchsrailers.org](mailto:jvazquez@lchsrailers.org)!

Please don't publish serious vulnerabilities to the public!

## Notifying of Vulnerabilities

We will not directly notify of any type of vulnerability. It is the responsibility of the user (the person in full control of the bot) to ensure they have the latest
or most secure version. Of course, read the LICENSE file for information on warranty and liability.
